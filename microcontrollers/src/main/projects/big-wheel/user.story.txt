Big Wheel User Story:

As the "Big Wheel" operator, 
I need to keep track of the contestants' spins,
so that the game state is correctly managed.

Acceptance Criteria - Game
01 - One or more players are required.

02 - A player is 'out' if they score more than 100 points.

03 - The 1st player in the current round becomes the 'high score 
     player' if they are not 'out' at the end of their turn.

04 - The game ends if there is no high score tie at the end of regulation or overtime.

05 - The winner is the player with the highest score under or at 100 points, if there 
     is no tie for highest score.

06 - There is no winner if all players are 'out' (went over 100 points).

07 - The 'Big Wheel' has 10 numbers in this order: 100, 15, 70, 55, 80, 20, 65, 35, 40, 10.
     * UPDATE THIS WITH THE ACTUAL VALUES.


Acceptance Criteria - Turns
01 - Each player gets a maximum of 2 spins in the regulation round.

02 - A player can stop at one spin.

03 - A player's turn ends if they reach 100 points in one or two spins.

04 - After player 1's turn, other players become the 'high score player' if 
     their score beats the previous player's score.

05 - Any spin that does not go 'all the way around' does not count and must be re-spun.

06 - A spin goes 'all the way around' if it moves the total number of spaces plus one.

Acceptance Criteria - Overtime 
01 - If any players are tied at or under 100 points, after each player has had thier turn, 
     then the tied players go to 'overtime' if their score is the high score.

02 - An 'overtime' round follows the same rules as regulation, with the exception that there is only one 
     spin per turn.

03 - At the end of an overtime round, if there are tied players then they play another overtime round, 
     until there is no tie.
